BTree-dd
========

BTree-dd is a lightwheight C++ template for managing B-Tree's data structures.
It is also known as "binary trees" or "red-black trees" (i.e., rb_tree) on
any CXX working fine.

Regardless of your needs, if you want to deal with large amounts of
information getters and setters in the blink of an eye, maybe BTrees are
better options than just traditional doubly-linked lists.

Think on it as a simplified but written from scratch template which is much
easier to use than rb_tree. More over, if you read the following line from
/usr/include/path/to/cpp/headers/bits/stl_tree.h:

	enum _Rb_tree_color { _S_red = false, _S_black = true };

You might be some confused about assigning boolean values to two colors,
which in turn are mapped to the number of the children branches, and
perhaps you will not be ever able to understand the data manipulation
algorithms.

That's where we introduce our own implementation of rb_trees (or should we
name them as cyan-white trees?), much cleaner and self-explained methods
and classes than the previous templates.

Look at the test/ directory for use cases and do "make check" on it to
get the unit tests results and summary.

There's a lot of work to do, so feedback is welcome off course.

Hope you enjoy!!!
