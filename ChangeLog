	0.2.0 Release
	* The method "init()" was created to be called from the constructor
	  as well as any other object, especially for btrees destroyed at
	  a first stage and being populated with new data with no need to
	  destroy the former object or use arrays of objects.

	* Methods "add_branch()", "get_leaf()" and "clear()" were rewritten
	  from scratch in order to get a cleaner, simplified and memory-safer
	  version of them.

	* Unit tests under "test/" subdirectory were improved to demonstrate
	  the right working of this template and how to interact with this
	  API.
